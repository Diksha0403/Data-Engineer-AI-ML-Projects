Title :- Breast Cancer Diagnosis using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
======================================================================

This project implements a simple and effective machine learning approach to classify breast cancer tumors as **Benign** or **Malignant** using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

---

It follows a basic ML workflow by :
    • Loading dataset from Scikit-learn
    • Understanding feature names and dataset structure
    • Splitting data into training & testing sets
    • Training a Support Vector Machine classifier (SVM)
    • Evaluating model accuracy using `metrics.accuracy_score()`

---

Dependencies :

Install the required Python packages before running the project:

    pip install scikit-learn numpy

---

Dataset Information :

    Source: Sklearn Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset
    
    Features (30):
    Numerical measurements of cell nuclei (e.g., radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.)
    
    Target:
        • 0 = Malignant
        • 1 = Benign

---

Workflow
=================

1. Dataset Loading & Inspection :

    • Load dataset with `datasets.load_breast_cancer()`
    • Display feature names
    • Display target names
    • Print dataset shape
    • Show first 5 records
    • Show target label array

---

2. Train-Test Split :

    • Split into 70% Train and 30% Test
    • `random_state=109` ensures reproducibility

---

3. Model Construction (SVM) :

    • Algorithm: Support Vector Machine
    • Kernel: `"linear"`
    • `clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear')`

---

4. Training & Evaluation :

    • Train: `clf.fit(x_train, y_train)`
    • Predict: `clf.predict(x_test)`
    • Evaluate using Accuracy Score
    
    Typical accuracy ranges between 95%–97%.

---

Running the Project
=====================
Run the script directly:
    python BreastCancerSupportVector.py

The output includes:
    • Dataset feature information
    • First few samples
    • Target labels
    • Final accuracy of the SVM model

---

Use Cases :

    • Medical ML classification
    • Understanding SVM for beginners
    • Academic assignments and ML demonstrations
    • Basic binary classification modeling
